1. Description
Sound Scheme Manager 2.0 is a program to create, manage and distribute Sound
Schemes. It is intended to work on OS/2 Warp and above. However Sound Schemes
were only introduced in OS/2 Warp 4.0. Thus I have created a new local profile
to store the schemes in. This has the advantage that I am not dependent on IBM
for the schemes and can add extra information. For OS/2 Warp 4.0 users the
ability to import and export schemes to the system profile will be added. Also
will be added the possibility to export schemes to zipfiles, provided Info Zip
is installed.

2. Targets
Sound Scheme Manager 2.0 should be released before the release of Warp 5.0, but
will be tested with the beta. Also does it have to be released before 1999. It
should be a complete program with the following specifications:
* Full managing of sound schemes:
  - Add
  - Delete
  - Change
  - Copy
  - Apply
  - Working with current scheme
* Gadgets:
  - Import
  - Export
  - Find
* Set volume
* Work with all versions of OS/2 Warp
* It should be a complete replacement of the Sound object in OS/2 Warp

3. To do
A lot has to be done:
* Fix managing of sound schemes (done)
   - Add (done)
   - Delete (done)
   - Change (done)
   - Copy (done)
   - Apply (done)
   - Current scheme (done)

4. Bugs
4.1 SSM Bugs
* Restore <current> doesn't work correctly when <current> is selected.
* alt-Backspace for undo doesn't work
4.2 OS/2 Bugs
* MMOS/2 misses one description, for End Drag: Add patch. (Does it? <=FP 5 
certainly, FP 6 solves it?)
